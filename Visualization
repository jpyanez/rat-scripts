How to visualize events in Geant4 & RAT

HepRApp
-------

You can read about it here:
http://geant4.slac.stanford.edu/Presentations/vis/G4HepRAppTutorial/G4HepRAppTutorial.html

Quickstart:

1. Add this to your script
/vis/open HepRepFile
/vis/heprep/setFileName file_name
/vis/drawVolume
/vis/scene/add/trajectories
/vis/scene/add/hits
/vis/viewer/flush

2. Run the script. No X forwarding needed.

3. You should see output with .heprep extension

4. Copy those files to a system with X forwarding or local machine

5. Get HepRApp to open them:
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~perl/HepRApp/HepRApp.jar

Heprep is slow, and does not display arbitrary volumes. You can test it with a one PMT setup:
Script:
https://github.com/jpyanez/rat-scripts/blob/master/greydisc_reflections/onedir_photons_onepmt.mac
You'll need these geometry files:
https://github.com/jpyanez/rat-scripts/blob/master/rat-geometries/pmtgeo.geo
https://github.com/jpyanez/rat-scripts/blob/master/rat-geometries/pmtinfo.ratdb

And to run it:
java -jar  path/to/HepRApp.jar
